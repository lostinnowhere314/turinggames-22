# turinggames-22
This repository holds the code for the [2022 Turing Games](https://www.theturinggames.com/) from team Random Forest (Sam Carpenter, Quinlan Leishman, Matthew Daw, and Jake Snow).

The 2022 Turing Games was a hackathon hosted by Texas A&M on 19 February 2022. The game consisted of an adversarial hide-and-seek game.
Over the course of about nine hours, teams developed AIs for both the hider and seeker roles, and there were separate leaderboards for each.
We won first place for hider, and second place for seeker. The winning code is contained in the files `macintosh_pro.py` (for the hider) and `seeker_uncamp.py` (for the seeker).
Other files show some stepping stones in the development, as well as several other attempted strategies and approaches.
